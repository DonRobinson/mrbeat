Beatbox program in Python
The program was written following the Udemy Course:
Python Developer | Complete course 2021, https://www.udemy.com/course/python-developer-complete-course/ by Jonathan Roux
This repository will be used to fix some bugs and add new features.
The bugs are:
1. There is a problem with the audiosource library where the Threading module can't be found. This is making it impossible to debug the program.
2. When the BPM, (beats per minute) are reduced from the initial value, the program reports that the buffer size used for sound is not correct
